    My goal with this project was to bring people together around caring for the land they maintain.  To strengthen the connections in the community.  To create a more accessible network of local and hobbiest food and take a bite out of big food industries. <a href="https://markehler.github.io/sol-sim_-_solar_energy_ethos"> blog </a>

<h2> It take an Ecosystem </h2>
<h3> Data Harvested Piecemeal </h3>
    All data was collected individually from <a href="https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/">NREL</a> test sites across the United States. This took a fair amount of cajoling because each site uniquely labeled their data, most of them sensing unique values from one another that had to be converted or ignored.

      Ultimately, it was important and reliable to collect the solar angles the sun traces across the sky and the temp.  Later, known latitude and longitude of each site was added in.  It would be possible, with more time and effort, to collect more weather data keyed off of a datetime index using nearby weather stations.  
<h3> Icarus Was Right</h3>
    At the center of our solar system lies a very large and very stable nuclear clock.  The graphs of geometric values returned from the test sites having watched the sun were so beautiful to a statistician, almost too beautiful.  It turns out that renewable energy is indeed reliable and hard to argue against.    <br><a href="https://imgur.com/YKPgEq5"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YKPgEq5.png" title="user input features" width="300" height="500", STYLE = "float: center;"></a><br>
    The Sun, undeniably the most important factor in generating solar energy, is
so reliable that astronomers can calculate where the great ball of fire will be in the sky at any time for any place.  This produces wonderfully normal distributions of the sun's location in the sky.  After doing feature analysis on some decision tree models, it is clear that the most important thing in solar production is where the sun is located.  The industry knows this, so when installing new solar panels we look for what is called a 'solar window', a box in the sky that the sun travels through most of the days throughout most of the year. <br>
