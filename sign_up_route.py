This code defines a route for the /signup page, which will display a form for users to enter their username, email, and password. When the form is submitted, the code will hash the user's password for security and store their information in a database. Finally, the user will be redirected to the login page.

Note that this code assumes you have a database set up and that you've defined an insert_user function to insert a new user into the database. You'll also need to create a signup.html template to render the signup form.
